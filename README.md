## Important

**I recommend to see each commit, For every commit I explain what I'm doing and you can see how was changed the code**

I'm working with the next design patterns:

1. Strategy pattern
2. Observer pattern
3. Decorator pattern
4. Factories
   - Simple factory (It is not considered officially a design pattern)
   - Factory method pattern
   - Abstract factory pattern
5. Singleton pattern(a few code, explains how deal with multithreading, and another things)
6. Command pattern
7. Adapter pattern
8. Facade pattern
9. Template method pattern
